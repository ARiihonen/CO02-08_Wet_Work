Infiltrate and prepare for your attack during the night. ADD MARKERS CONTAINING THE STRING 'INFIL' AND OPTIONALLY YOUR TEAM NAME ('RED' OR 'BLUE') TO CHOOSE A STARTING POSITION WITHIN THE BLUE MARKERS.
<br /> <br />
When you have completed your nighttime tasks, select "Ready to wait" from your action menu. Once everyone is ready, this will fast forward the time to 0445. The target is set to arrive at 0500.
<br /> <br />
Capture the target and exfiltrate him to <marker name = 'marker_end'>the lake</marker> in a boat. <marker name = 'marker_hq'>The enemy regimental headquarters</marker> should have boats next to it.
<br /> <br />
If capturing the target seems impossible, kill him and extract.
