Select your starting position from within <marker name = 'marker_shore_1'>the two</marker> <marker name = 'marker_shore_2'>blue markers</marker>, by <font color='#1E90FF'>placing a marker containing the text 'infil' and optionally your team name ('Red' or 'Blue') within the blue zones</font>. You will start in the water near the marker. Should no applicable marker be placed, you will start at a default starting position.

Once you are finished with your preparations during the night, you can select <font color='#228B22'>'Ready to wait'</font> from your action menu. Once all players are ready, <font color='#228B22'>the mission will fast-forward to 0445</font>, giving you 15 minutes to prepare before the target is set to arrive at the HQ.
<br /> <br />
Destroying any of the boats or killing several patrols at any point of the mission will force the local leaders to admit they do not have total control over the area, and the target will turn away at first contact with local troops. The mission will not fail, you will need to identify the situation and to extract from the area yourselves. Lesser disturbances like the disappearance of a patrol or two might not spook the target, and if he decides to turn away he will at least meet up with the local leader first.

Your backpack includes a plate carrier, so you can stash your heavy rebreather somewhere during a phase of the mission where you would rather have a lighter load than be able to dive.
