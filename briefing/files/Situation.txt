A civil war broke out with the Russian-backed Finnish Protection Corps rebelling against government forces.

The FPC gained ground quickly due to the underfunded FDF not being able to respond with sufficient speed and force. Their advances have, however, halted, with the FDF managing to bring in the reserves.

A russian colonel is about to inspect an FPC base next to Valtatie 5 near Mikkeli. The area is sufficiently behind the lines and out of reach from the press for the russians to operate openly. A team of finnish combat divers has been sent to capture the colonel, in order to gain even more proof of Russia's extensive involvement in the rebellion.
